# Password Validator

Passwords are validated by comparing a user-provided
value with a known value that’s stored. Either it’s correct or
it’s not.

Create a simple program that validates user login credentials.

The program must prompt the user for a username and
password. The program should compare the password given
by the user to a known password. If the password matches,
the program should display “Welcome!” If it doesn’t match,
the program should display “I don’t know you.”


### Constraints
Use an if/else statement for this problem.
Make sure the program is case sensitive.
