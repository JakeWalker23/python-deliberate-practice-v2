#Temperature Converter

Youâ€™ll often need to determine which part of a program is run based on user input or other events.
Create a program that converts temperatures from Fahrenheit to Celsius or from Celsius to Fahrenheit.Prompt for the starting temperature. The program should prompt for the type of conversion and then perform the conversion.

## Formula:
	C = (F - 32) * 5/9

	F = (C * 9 / 5) + 32


## Inputs, Process, Outputs
Inputs / Outputs = Temperature, Fahrenheit, Celsius, type of Conversion
Processes = converts, prompt

## Constraints

Allow for upper and lower case values for C and F

Use as few output statements as possible and avoid repeating output strings
