## Challenges

If the user enters a number thatâ€™s less than zero or enters non-numeric data, display an error message that asks the user to enter a valid age.

Instead of hard-coding the driving age in your program logic, research driving ages for various countries and create a lookup table for the driving ages and countries. Prompt for the age, and display which countries the user can legally drive in.
