## Tax Calculator

You don’t always need a complex control structure to solve simple problems. Sometimes a program requires an extra
step in one case, but in all other cases there’s nothing to do. Write a simple program to compute the tax on an order
amount. The program should prompt for the order amount and the state. If the state is “WI,” then the order must be
charged 5.5% tax. The program should display the subtotal, tax, and total for Wisconsin residents but display just the
total for non-residents.


#### Verbs = compute, prompt, display
#### Nouns = tax, order amount, state

#### Test Plan

order amount = 4
state = 'WI'
subtotal = 4
tax = 0.22 (5.5%)
total = 4.22

or 

4 


order amount = 150
state = 'WI'
subtotal = 150
tax = 8.25 (5.5%)
total = 158.25
