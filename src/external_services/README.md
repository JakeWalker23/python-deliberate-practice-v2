# Whos in Space?

Did you know you can find out exactly who’s in space right
now? The Open Notify API provides that information. Visit
http://api.open-notify.org/astros.json to see not only how many people are currently in space but also their names and which spacecraft they’re on.

Create a program that pulls in this data and displays the
information from this API in a tabular format.

### Example Output

There are 3 people in space right now:
-----Name | ----------Craft ---------|
Gennady Padalka | ISS
Mikhail Kornienko | ISS
Scott Kelly | ISS
