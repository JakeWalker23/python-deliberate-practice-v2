# Pizza Party


## Problem Statement

Division isn’t always exact, and sometimes you’ll write programs that will need to deal with the leftovers as a whole number instead of a decimal.

Write a program to evenly divide pizzas. Prompt for the number of people, the number of pizzas, and the number of slices per pizza. 

Ensure that the number of pieces comes out even. Display the number of pieces of pizza each person should get. 
If there are leftovers, show the number of leftover pieces.
